* Install
Get the file, add to load path, and
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'eldoc-box)
#+END_SRC

It is also available on [[https://melpa.org/#/eldoc-box][MELPA]].

* Usage
*Note:* If you use Gnome and Emacs 27, set ~x-gtk-resize-child-frames~ to ~resize-mode~ to avoid breakage of childframe.

** Function
- =eldoc-box-hover-mode= :: Display documentation of the symbol at point in a childframe on upper corner.
- =eldoc-box-hover-at-point-mode= :: Same as =eldoc-box-hover-mode= except the childframe is displayed at point, instead of on the upper corner.
- =eldoc-box-eglot-help-at-point= :: See below.
** Face
-  =eldoc-box-border= :: Adjust =:background= of this face for border color.
- =eldoc-box-body= :: Default face used by childframe.  I suggest to use a nice Sans Serif font such as Source Sans Pro, and a lighter or darker background.
** Hooks
- =eldoc-box-buffer-hook= :: Hook run after buffer for doc is setup.Run inside the new buffer.
- =eldoc-box-frame-hook= :: Hook run after doc frame is setup but just before it is made visible.Each function runs inside the child frame and receives the main frame as argument.
** Variable
- =eldoc-box-max-pixel-width= & =eldoc-box-max-pixel-height= :: Set them according to the screen resolution of your machine.
- =eldoc-box-only-multi-line= :: Set this to non-nil and eldoc-box only display multi-line message in childframe. One line messages are left in minibuffer.
- =eldoc-box-cleanup-interval= :: After this amount of seconds will eldoc-box attempt to cleanup the childframe. E.g. if it is set to 1, the childframe is cleared 1 second after you moved the point to somewhere else (that doesn't have a doc to show). This doesn't apply to =eldoc-box-hover-at-point-mode=, in that mode the childframe is cleared as soon as point moves.
- =eldoc-box-fringe-use-same-bg= :: T means fringe's background color is set to as same as that of default. Default to t.
- =eldoc-box-self-insert-command-list= :: By default =eldoc-box-hover-at-point-mode= only keeps childframe display while you are typing (=self-insert-command=). But if you bind something else to your keys, eldoc-box can’t recognize it and will hide childframe while yu hit that key. Add your command to this list so eldoc-box won’t hide childframe when this command is called.

** Use with eglot
As of writing this README, eglot doesn't have a public mode hook, use this hook:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eglot--managed-mode-hook #'eldoc-box-hover-mode t)
#+END_SRC

To keep eldoc from displaying documentation at point without enabling any minor mode above: =(add-to-list 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilites :hoverProvider)=.

Eldoc-box also provides a convenient command =eldoc-box-eglot-help-at-point=. Calling this command on a symbol displays a documentation childframe at point. No need to enable any minor mode for this.
