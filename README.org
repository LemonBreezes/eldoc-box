- =eldoc-box-cleanup-interval= :: After this amount of seconds will eldoc-box attempt to cleanup the childframe. E.g. if it is set to 1, the childframe is cleared 1 second after you moved the point to somewhere else (that doesn't have a doc to show).
** Use with eglot
As of writing this README, eglot doesn't have a public mode hook, use this hook:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eglot--managed-mode-hook #'eldoc-box-hover-mode t)
#+END_SRC
